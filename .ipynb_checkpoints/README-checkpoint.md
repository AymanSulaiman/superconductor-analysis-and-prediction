# superconductor-analysis-and-prediction

## Introduction
Superconductivity is a phenomenon where a charge can move through a material without any resistance. This allows electricity to be conducted at maximum efficientcy.  However, they need to super-cooled to near 0 Kelvin for the materials to overcome a pair of electrons repulsion and become Cooper pairs. Given this low state of energy, the identity of an induvidual electron becomes uncertain and pass throught the sea of electrons in the super cooled material. The warmest superconductor that currently exists was made in the Planck Institute of Chemistry was made with Lanthium Hydride (LaH10)  that has said to be observed at -23 degrees C or 205K which is warmer than the North Pole. Superconductors have their uses in MRI scanners, NMR Machines and partical accelerators.

I am doing this to build different AI's for different projects with this data. 

Projects:
* Predicting super critical temperature using TensorFlow(Batteries included)
* Predicting super critical temperature using using PyTorch as way of learning PyTorch 
* predicting what elements are required to build the supercritical conductor using TensorFlow(Batteries included)
